## This is a workshop plannned for students.

It is still a WIP, but all the parts are mostly there. 

The plan is to have a foundation laid down for students to learn Nextjs and the basics on how to use Fabric.

The workflow will be for all the test commented out, as well as a lot of code removed. Then the students can uncomment
one test after the other and implement the necessary features until the test passes, and then continue with the next test.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
